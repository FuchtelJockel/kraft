The difference between the unsafe-variant the the "safe" variant is that
the unsafe variant does render html tags in post-, pre- and item texts.

HTML Tags in texts are not enabled in Kraft by default.

bnc-letter.gtmpl is a template to write a letter with Kraft. It skips the
items and uses pre- and post-text.
