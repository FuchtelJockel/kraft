KAnge README
============
Jun 2005, Klaas Freitag <kange@freisturz.de>


KAnge will be a program to organise the office of small craftsmen
business. It will help to write offers and invoices.

For that, it handles catalogs that organise materials and template
texts that can appear in the documents for the customer. It focuses
on good printouts because that is still the main communication media
in the craftsmen business.

The main purpose of this peace of software is to provide something
that can not only be used by nerds but also but people that usually
are not interested in computer work at all but feel that they have
to use one to face the business. Specialised software for craftsmen
is usually very expensive and unfortunately not really good in my
opinion. I follow the market for software for landscaper for more
than 10 years now and I did not see a product that has
 - a real intuitive GUI
 - a set of features that a non nerd needs. That means that most of
   the software has way too much features. They're prepared for every
   use case one might think of and since implementing features seems
   to be easy they do not focus on simplicity enough.
 - support for Linux.

I know that it is foolhardy to think to start something that can be
better here, but there is nothing in this direction open source yet. 
However there are real good tools that can be used like kugar for 
example and I think and hope that this project can benefit from that.


KAnge is strongly under development, so there is very little of 
functionality yet. Especially there is no way to generate documents
by now. You only can manage catalogs. Other things will hopefully 
follow.

KAnge is developed following the german 'best practices' and german
laws etc. I am not sure if it makes sense/is possible to use it
in other countries than germany. KAnge's first and example user is 
a landscaper company with 6 people, office work is usually done by 
the boss after a workday on the building site. I do not hope, but
it might be that KAnge will be influenced by the need of landscapers.
I promise to avoid where possible to open it up to all other trades.

Interested?
===========

If you are interested, please speak up. If you are a developer and
like to participate, please send email to me <kange@freisturz.de>.

Installation
============

KAnge hopefully compiles out of the box. The Qt database classes must
be installed. It needs a running MySQL database to store the catalogs
in it. Although I love MySQL I will "port" KAnge to SQLite because
it's easier to get to work and no server is required.  Check the
database directory to see how to set up the database initially for the
time being. The database name, username, passwd and host are defined
in kangedb.cpp and get compiled in. I know that's bad, need to go into
a config file.

KAnge supports the environment variable KANGE_HOME that should point
to upper kange directoy. If the environment var is set, the ui files
are searched for in $KANGE_HOME/kange/. That is usefull for development
without installing.
