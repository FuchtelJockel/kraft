This release 0.20 of Kraft brings a big step ahead in the way text
templates for the header and footer texts for the different doc types
are managed. Kraft now supports to have several templates per type
(ie. for the header of invoices) and all of them are offered very
handy right to select from a catalog kind in a context aware manner.

Kraft takes another important step towards a really well integrated
KDE addressbook. All customer addresses are managed in the KDE
addressbook but there is a customer catalog now integrated.

This release contains a lot of important bug fixes and small additions
to functionality, update is really recommended.
