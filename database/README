Kraft - solution for open craft
===============================

Kraft is a program that supports craftsmen in their daily
jobs: making offers, invoices and confirmations.

Kraft needs a mysql database running. But setup is easy,
please try it. 


How to setup the database?
==========================
First, install the mysql packages of your distribution.
Create a database user and select a suitable password.
Please replace the word 'user' in the following code
examples with the user name you created.

The database can be set up using the creation scripts
in Krafts database directory. The scripts do create
the database completely new, even if they exists. 
Unfortunately there is no migration mechanism yet, 
sorry for that. 

To create the database, perform the following steps:

cd database
mysql -u user -p < create_schema.sql

this creates the database tables in database kange. 

ATTENTION: The command above deletes the database kange
if it already exists. THERE IS NO BACKUP DONE YET!!

Fill the database with initial content:

mysql -u user -p kange < fill_schema_de.sql

this fills the database with some basic settings for
language german. Other fill_schema scripts for other
languages can be written, thats the reason for why
these are two scripts.

That's it.
