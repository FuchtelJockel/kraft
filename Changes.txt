Changes since version 0.14:

- fixed bug with manual price field that needs to be left by
  TAB to get a change recognised.
- increased precision to 2 digits for position amounts
- allow euro-sign in texts and in the whiteboard. Due to a lack
  in the qt3 mysql driver the char needs to be en- and decoded.

Bugs fixed:
- fixed time lined doc overview, now displaying all documents of
  all months of a year.
