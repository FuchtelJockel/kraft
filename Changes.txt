Changes since version 0.14:

- fixed bug with manual price field that needs to be left by
  TAB to get a change recognised.
- increased precision to 2 digits for position amounts

  in the qt3 mysql driver the char needs to be en- and decoded.

  ones.
- more beautifull and working navigation block in the document dialog
- mailing documents added
- Completely changed header- and footer text template system: 
  * more than on e text available per text- and doc type
  * direct adding, editing and removing of texts from the dialog
  * selecting template texts in the same way as selecting position 
    templates
- persist the selection of the greeting and salut text 

Bugs fixed:
- fixed time lined doc overview, now displaying all documents of
  all months of a year.
- fixed modification indication: Now also adding a position counts
  as modification
- encoding bugs fixed
